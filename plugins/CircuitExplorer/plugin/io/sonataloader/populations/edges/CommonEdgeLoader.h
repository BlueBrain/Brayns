 * @brief The CommonEdgePopulationLoader class implements the edge load
 * functionality to read a wide variety of edge population types that share the
 * same mandatory datasets, allowing to have a common functionality.
 * Nonetheless, and even though all such functionality is implemented on this
 * class, it exists a class for one of each of these types of edge populations,
 * that simply extend this one. This is done so its easier to understand the
