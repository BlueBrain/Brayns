/** Loads a NEST circuit from file and stores it into a cache file containing

 * --nest-cache-file command line parameter. If the cache file does not exist,
 * it is created and
 * populated by the import process. The format of the cache file is a array of
 * float values
 * representing the activation timestamp by GUID. GUID are ordered in the same
 * way as they are
 * read from the original NEST circuit. All frames of the simulation are stored
 * one after the other.
 * The cache file contains a header of two uint64_t. The first one is the number
 * of frame, and the
 * second one is the frame size (the number of floats per frame). The cache file
 * is handled bu the
 * SpikeSimulationHandler class.
 * Note that in the current implementation, the simulation can only be played
 * forward.
