/**
 * Defines the abstract representation of an extension plug-in. What we mean by
 * extension is a set a functionalities that are not provided by the core of the
 * application. For example, exposing a REST interface via HTTP, or streaming
 * images to an distant display.
 *
 * For a plugin to be loaded dynamically at runtime, the following function
 * must be available in the library:
 *
 * @code
 * extern "C" brayns::ExtensionPlugin* brayns_plugin_create(int argc, const
 * char** argv)
 * @endcode
 *
 * It must return the instance of the plugin, and from hereon Brayns owns the
 * plugin and calls preRender() and postRender() accordingly.
 * In the shutdown sequence of Brayns, the plugin will be destructed properly.
