 *
 * For a plugin to be loaded dynamically at runtime, the following function
 * must be available in the library:
 *
 * @code
 * extern "C" brayns::ExtensionPlugin* brayns_plugin_create(brayns::PluginAPI*,

 * @endcode

 * It must return the instance of the plugin, and from hereon Brayns owns the

 * In the shutdown sequence of Brayns, the plugin will be destructed properly.
