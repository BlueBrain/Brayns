/**
    Brayns is a minimalistic library that allows optimized ray-tracing rendering
    of meshes and parametric geometry. Brayns provides an abstraction of the
    underlying rendering engines, making it possible to use the best rendering
    engine depending on the case.

    The scene is initialized according to parameters provided to the Brayns
    constructor. Those parameters are related to the application itself, the
    geometry and the renderer. During the initialization process, Brayns creates
    the scene using loaders located in the braynsPlugins library.

    The underlying rendering engine (OSPRay, Optix, FireRays, etc) is specified
    in the rendering parameters and is invoked by the render method for
    generating the frames.

    Underlying rendering engines support CPU, GPU and heterogenous architectures

    This object exposes the basic API for Brayns
