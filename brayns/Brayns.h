/**
    Brayns is a minimalistic library that allows optimized ray-tracing rendering
    of meshes and parametric geometry. Brayns provides an abstraction of the
    underlying rendering engines, making it possible to use the best rendering
    engine depending on the case.

    Brayns uses plugins for extended function. There are a few built-in plugins
    and additional plugins can be dynamically loaded.

    The underlying rendering engine (OSPRay, Optix, FireRays, etc) is specified
    in the rendering parameters and is invoked by the render method for
    generating the frames.

    Underlying rendering engines support CPU, GPU and heterogeneous
    architectures

    This object exposes the basic API for Brayns

     * In a setup using event loops, the event loop must be set up correctly
     * before calling this constructor to ensure that plugins can install their
